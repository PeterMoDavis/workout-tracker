# Workout Tracker

## Description

The motivation for this project was to develope the back-end of an app that tracks the users exercise routines. They can start a new workout routine and then add multiple exersises to that routine which saves different variables to the Mongo DB. This is then used to render different charts with the information displayed. While developing the project i learned basic concepts of using the Mongo Database as well as MongooseJS to access and model the database.
